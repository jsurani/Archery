# Archery
Built an archery game with user input, target logic, collision detection, and score tracking.
In each of these 5 rounds, fires 3 arrows. With every shot a 1 in 3 chance to hit the bullseye.

For each shot, printed out the round number and the shot within that round
Followed by an “X” if you made the shot or an “O” if missed
For example, if it missed the first two shots, the program should print out:
Round 1, arrow 1: O
Round 1, arrow 2: O

Lastly, counted the total number of bullseyes hit and display this number at the end.
